This is the code for the tabular and continuous model-based and model-free estimators in the paper
(i.e. all the experiments except for the reparameterized estimator with brax).


To get the 2d continuous control plots, run
`python continuous_main.py`

To get the SNAP plots (in the appendix), run
`python tabular_main.py --experiment_name "snap"`

To get the VPN plots, run
`python tabular_main.py --experiment_name "vpn"`

To get the Customer Service Center plots (shown in the appendix), run
`python tabular_main.py --experiment_name "customer"`

To get the Customer Service Center plots (shown in the appendix) with the model-free algorithm, run
`python model-free-main.py`
